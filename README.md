# About this website
In an era where sleek, modern designs have become the norm for blogs, we're taking a nostalgic detour back to the Web 1.0 era with our Small Blog Website project. This venture is not just about creating a functional blog platform; it's also about injecting some humor and charm into the digital world.
## Project Goals
- Develop a small, lightweight blog website inspired by the classic Web 1.0 design aesthetic.
- Create an engaging user experience that stands out from typical cookie-cutter blogs.
- Implement essential features for a basic blog, such as creating and editing posts, adding images, and managing comments.
- Infuse humor into the project to make it memorable and fun for users.
## Why Web 1.0?
The Web 1.0 design era, which spanned roughly from 1991 to 2004, was characterized by minimalistic designs, simple layouts, and text-heavy content. I'm not trying to replicate the technical limitations of that time but rather draw inspiration from its aesthetic and unique quirks. My goal is to create a blog that feels fresh, light, and reminiscent of the early days of the internet.
Also, I develop corporate websites at my job so I wanned to do something different.
